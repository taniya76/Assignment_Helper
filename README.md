  ## Points to remember while testing the app

1. In case any **Assignment is not broadcasted** it is probably due to server overload, **Wait** for the window to solve this. 
2. After Submission of Assignment just Wait for few Seconds. It take some time to save the data in Database.
3. Make sure the **URL** is starting with https


  ## Instructions


1. `git clone https://github.com/taniya76/Assignment_Helper.git` 
2. `cd ./Assignment_Helper`
3. Install node dependencies 
   - `npm install`
4. Replace firebase API keys with your configurations
   (Currently I added my Credentials for testing but soon I will remove them)
5. Create a `.env` file 
   - Add relevant credentials
   - `cp .env.example .env` 
6. `npm start`
7. The Website is now running at http://localhost:3000/
